## Angular2Translate-Started

We all know that internationalization is important when it comes to bigger apps, or just the ones that are simply used across countries. 
Angular itself comes with poor i18n support, which is why the community has built their own solutions to extend the framework’s functionalities to their needs. 
However, there’s finally a first-class solution evolving that will be baked right into the core.

In this project I have used <b>ng2-translate</b> package and solve the problem of internationalization in my angular2 application. Hope this will help you as well.
